Hello dear Agentree ðŸŒ¸

Hereâ€™s the complete big picture for Allinya â€” not to build right now, but so you can see the entire ecosystem we are creating.

â¸»

ðŸ’Ž OVERVIEW

Allinya is a real-time wellness marketplace connecting Guests and Practitioners instantly â€” no scheduling, no booking delays.

A Guest can see whoâ€™s online, choose a Practitioner, pay, and enter a live video session immediately.
Everything must be clean, minimal, and intuitive.

ðŸ©µ 1. AUTHENTICATION

We use Supabase Auth for login via email.
	â€¢	When a user signs in, a minimal profile is auto-created (email + role).
	â€¢	Role options: Guest or Practitioner.
	â€¢	Guests see practitioners.
	â€¢	Practitioners manage their profiles and availability.

ðŸ©µ 2. PRACTITIONER PROFILE

Each Practitioner can:
	â€¢	Add name, bio, and up to 3 specialties.
	â€¢	Upload 1 avatar, 3 gallery images, and 1 short video.
	â€¢	Set prices for 5, 15, 30, and 60-minute sessions.
	â€¢	Toggle Online / Offline status (visible to Guests).

ðŸ©µ 3. GUEST PROFILE

Each Guest has:
	â€¢	Name, avatar, and country (editable).
	â€¢	Access to the full Practitioner grid, showing who is online.
	â€¢	Ability to click a Practitioner, choose a session length, pay instantly, and enter the call.

ðŸ©µ 4. STRIPE CONNECT (Payments)

We will use Stripe Connect for payments and payouts.
	â€¢	Guests pay instantly for each session.
	â€¢	Funds go to the Practitionerâ€™s connected account minus Allinyaâ€™s service fee.
	â€¢	Stripe dashboard handles taxes, verification, and payouts.
	â€¢	No subscriptions or pre-booking â€” every transaction is real-time.

ðŸ©µ 5. AGORA (Live Video)

We use Agora SDK for all live video calls.
	â€¢	1-on-1 video with crystal-clear latency.
	â€¢	Sessions start after the Room Timer Countdown (5 min).
	â€¢	Then switch automatically to the Live Video Timer Countdown (5, 15, 30, 60 min).
	â€¢	Rejoin is possible as long as any timer is still active.
