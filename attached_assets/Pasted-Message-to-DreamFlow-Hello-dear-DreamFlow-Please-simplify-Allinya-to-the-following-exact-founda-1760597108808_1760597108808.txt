Hello dear DreamFlow ðŸŒ¸

Please simplify Allinya to the following exact foundation.
We will complexify later â€” but for now, this must be the entire structure, clean and functional.

ðŸ©µ PRACTITIONER SIDE

1. Profile
When a practitioner signs in:
	â€¢	A minimal profile is automatically created (email only).
	â€¢	The practitioner fills in the rest:
	â€¢	Name
	â€¢	Bio
	â€¢	Specialties (up to 3)
	â€¢	Avatar
	â€¢	Three gallery photos
	â€¢	One video (main video)

All of these must save correctly to Supabase and display instantly.

2. Online / Offline State
	â€¢	Practitioner can toggle between Online and Offline.
	â€¢	When Online, the practitioner appears visible to guests.
	â€¢	When Offline, the practitioner disappears from the guest view.

3. Alerts & Sessions
When a guest selects a session (5 / 15 / 30 / 60 minutes),
	â€¢	The practitioner receives an alert (message or signal).
	â€¢	After accepting, both enter a 5-minute Room Timer Countdown (always use this exact term).
	â€¢	When the Room Timer ends, both are connected through the Live Video Timer Countdown (15 / 30 / 60 minutes â€” depending on what the guest chose).
	â€¢	This Live connection uses the Agora SDK.

ðŸ©µ GUEST SIDE

1. Profile
When a guest signs in:
	â€¢	A minimal profile is automatically created (email only).
	â€¢	The guest can edit:
	â€¢	Name
	â€¢	Avatar
	â€¢	Country

Everything must save correctly and show instantly.

2. Explore View
	â€¢	The guest instantly sees all Practitioners â€” both online and offline.
	â€¢	When a guest clicks an online practitioner:
	â€¢	They select the duration (5 / 15 / 30 / 60 minutes).
	â€¢	This triggers the Room Timer Countdown â†’ then the Live Video Timer Countdown as described above.

â¸»

ðŸ©µ NAMING ABSOLUTE TRUTHS

For the entire app, these are the only valid timer names:
	â€¢	Room Timer Countdown â†’ always 5 minutes
	â€¢	Live Video Timer Countdown â†’ 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes

No other naming or variations should ever be used.

This is all that must exist right now â€” nothing more.
Once this is fully stable and verified, we will expand and complexify step by step.
