Help me to debug the attached sql snippet which gives the following error:

I will list the database tables and extensions to understand column types and available UUID columns (no inputs required). I'll fetch tables and extensions now.

Summary
You have a PostgreSQL error: operator does not exist: text = uuid. This means your query is comparing a text value to a uuid column (or vice‑versa). PostgreSQL won't implicitly cast text to uuid for the = operator, so you must make the types match explicitly.

Below are the common causes and step-by-step fixes.

Common causes
Comparing a text literal (or a column of type text/varchar) to a uuid column, e.g. user_id = 'abc-123-...'.
Comparing a JSON/JSONB value or JWT claim (text) to a uuid column without casting.
Using functions returning text (e.g., auth.jwt() ->> 'sub') and comparing directly to a uuid column.
How to fix
Cast the text to uuid (preferred when the text is a valid UUID):

Example: SELECT ... WHERE user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::uuid;
Or explicitly: WHERE user_id = CAST('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' AS uuid);
Cast the uuid to text (less preferred for indexes/joins because it prevents index use):

Example: WHERE user_id::text = some_text_column;
If comparing a JWT claim or JSON field, extract without text operator or cast:

If you used auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id' (returns text), cast to uuid: WHERE tenant_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'tenant_id')::uuid;
If using auth.jwt() -> 'tenant_id' (returns json), you can do: WHERE tenant_id = (auth.jwt() -> 'tenant_id')::text::uuid (but ->> then cast to uuid is simpler).
Ensure literals are well-formed UUIDs. If the string is not a valid UUID, casting will fail with an error; validate or use safe checks:

WHERE user_id = NULLIF(your_text, '')::uuid
Or use try-catch in application code.
Examples
Fixing a join where left is text and right is uuid:

Problem: JOIN organizations o ON o.id = up.organization_id_text
Fix: JOIN organizations o ON o.id = up.organization_id_text::uuid
Policy using auth.uid():

Correct: CREATE POLICY ... USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id);
If user_id is text: CREATE POLICY ... USING ((SELECT auth.uid())::text = user_id);
Comparing JWT custom claim:

Correct: WHERE organization_id = (auth.jwt() ->> 'organization_id')::uuid
How I can help next
If you paste the exact SQL snippet that errors, I will point to the precise line and give the corrected SQL.
If you want, I can suggest safer casting patterns or provide a small helper function to validate UUID strings before casting.
Paste the snippet and I'll produce the fixed query.

Casting uuid to text (option 2) — explanation and examples
If you want to compare a uuid column to a text value by converting the uuid to text, cast the uuid column using ::text (or CAST(... AS text)). Note this can prevent index use on the uuid column, so prefer casting the text to uuid when possible. Still, when you explicitly choose to cast uuid → text, use one of the patterns below.

Examples and patterns:

Simple equality

SQL QUERY



-- uuid column compared to a text literal
WHERE user_id::text = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000';

Comparing uuid column to a text column

SQL QUERY



-- join where right side is text
JOIN users u ON u.id::text = external_source.user_id_text;

In RLS / policy expressions using auth.uid()

SQL QUERY



-- auth.uid() returns uuid; if your table stores user_id as text:
CREATE POLICY "user_access" ON my_table
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING ((SELECT auth.uid())::text = user_id);

When extracting from JSON/JSONB where you have a uuid stored as JSON (-> returns JSON)

SQL QUERY



-- assuming json_data->'user_id' is a json string, compare to uuid column cast to text
WHERE (json_data->>'user_id') = user_id::text;

When using joins with functions returning text

SQL QUERY



-- get_user_external_id() returns text, compare to uuid column cast to text
JOIN accounts a ON a.id::text = get_user_external_id(users.id);

Important notes:

Casting uuid to text prevents PostgreSQL from using an index on the uuid column for that comparison. If performance matters, prefer casting the text side to uuid instead.
If the text value may not be a valid UUID, casting the text to uuid will throw an error; in that case you can guard with a validation function or use a safe conditional, e.g.:
SQL QUERY



WHERE user_id::text = some_text
  AND some_text ~* '^[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$';
``*

If you paste the exact SQL snippet that's failing, I will modify it to use ::text where appropriate and point out any potential index/performance impacts.
