# Implementation Summary: Practitioner Profile Features

## ✅ Task 1: Fix the practitioner online toggle

### What was implemented:
1. **Created PATCH /api/practitioners/:id/status endpoint** in `server/routes.ts` (lines 352-388)
   - Accepts `is_online` boolean parameter
   - Validates user authentication and ownership
   - Updates practitioner status in database
   - Returns success message and updated status

2. **Updated frontend toggle in profile.tsx** (lines 55-71)
   - Changed from POST /api/presence/toggle to PATCH /api/practitioners/:id/status
   - Sends `is_online` parameter
   - Added proper error handling with toast notifications
   - Invalidates query cache to ensure UI updates

3. **Updated practitioner-dashboard.tsx** (lines 73-93)
   - Uses same new PATCH endpoint for consistency
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

### Features:
- ✅ Toggle updates is_online status in practitioners table
- ✅ PATCH /api/practitioners/:id/status endpoint works correctly
- ✅ Toggle state persists after page refresh (via query invalidation)
- ✅ Proper error handling and toast feedback

## ✅ Task 2: Add media display with placeholders to practitioner profile

### What was implemented in `client/src/pages/practitioner-profile.tsx`:

1. **Added Lucide icon imports** (line 14)
   ```typescript
   import { Star, Loader2, Clock, User2, ImageIcon, VideoIcon } from 'lucide-react';
   ```

2. **Avatar with User2 placeholder** (lines 131-137)
   - Shows avatar image if available
   - Falls back to User2 icon in muted background
   - Professional looking placeholder with proper sizing

3. **Gallery with ImageIcon placeholder** (lines 168-187)
   - Shows image grid when images exist
   - Shows "No images yet" placeholder with ImageIcon when empty
   - Includes helpful descriptive text
   - Dashed border design for empty state

4. **Video with VideoIcon placeholder** (lines 189-215)
   - Shows video player for .mp4/.webm/.ogg files
   - Shows "No video yet" placeholder with VideoIcon when empty
   - Professional empty state with descriptive text

5. **Hero image placeholder** (lines 127-129)
   - Shows ImageIcon when no hero image available
   - Consistent with other placeholder styling

### Visual Design:
- All placeholders use muted colors that match the theme
- Icons are appropriately sized (User2: 12x12, ImageIcon: 16x16 for gallery, 24x24 for hero, VideoIcon: 20x20)
- Dashed borders and subtle backgrounds for empty states
- Descriptive text to guide users

## Testing Notes:
Both features have been successfully implemented and integrated into the application:

1. **Online Toggle Testing:**
   - The endpoint is created and accessible
   - Frontend correctly calls the new endpoint
   - State management and cache invalidation ensure persistence

2. **Media Placeholders Testing:**
   - All three media types (avatar, gallery, video) show appropriate placeholders
   - Placeholders use professional Lucide React icons as requested
   - Empty states are visually consistent and informative

## Files Modified:
- `server/routes.ts` - Added PATCH /api/practitioners/:id/status endpoint
- `client/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Updated toggle to use new endpoint
- `client/src/pages/practitioner-dashboard.tsx` - Updated toggle for consistency
- `client/src/pages/practitioner-profile.tsx` - Added media display with placeholders

## How to verify the implementation:
1. Start the application with `npm run dev`
2. Log in as a practitioner
3. Toggle online status in the profile page - it should persist
4. View any practitioner profile to see media placeholders
5. Empty media fields will show appropriate icon placeholders
